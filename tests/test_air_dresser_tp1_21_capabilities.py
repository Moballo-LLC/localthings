"""Tests for the DA_DF_TP1_21_COMMON AirDresser (model DF3000B, issue #208).

Another board generation routed into the same air_dresser registry as
issue #162's DA_DF_A51_20_COMMON and issue #157's DA_DF_TP2_20_COMMON.
Exercises the one thing this board reports that neither of those does:
a populated /buzzersound/vs/0 (laundry.BUZZER_SOUND) -- the reporter's
actual ask ("all cycles are represented by code") is a course-code
labelling problem, not a coverage one; this board's course table isn't
identified yet either (same as #162's), so 'cycle' still renders as the
raw code until a reporter can map codes to names in the SmartThings app.
