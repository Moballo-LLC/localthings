"""What the second element of a /sensors/vs/0 dust reading means, and why
it is what confirms Dust/FineDust/SuperFineDust are PM10/PM2.5/PM1.

`x.com.samsung.da.value` is `[concentration, grade]` on the fields that
carry a magnitude and `[grade]` on Odor/CleanLevel, which are grades
already. Index 1 is never bound to an entity (its floor differs by board
family), but it is the device's own opinion about its own readings, and
that makes it the one piece of evidence for the PM mapping that doesn't
depend on Samsung's field names or on a user's screenshot.

These assertions read the shipped fixtures rather than restating numbers,
so a re-captured dump that contradicts the mapping fails here instead of
silently weakening the argument in air_purifier.py's comment.
