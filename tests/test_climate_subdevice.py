"""Tests that a subdevice's LocalThingsClimate entity (issue #177) reads its
*own* power/mode/temperature -- not the master's, and not some mix of the
two -- and that the legacy-board test (is_legacy_board/_legacy_airflow) is
evaluated per subdevice rather than once globally.

Uses the issue #177 reporter's ARTIK051_DONGLE_FAC_18K fixture deliberately:
it's a legacy `/airflow/vs/<n>` board (no `/wind/*` at all) on *both* the
master and its materialized sibling, which is exactly the shape climate.py's
own comments warn is easy to get wrong if the canonical view leaks between
subdevices.
