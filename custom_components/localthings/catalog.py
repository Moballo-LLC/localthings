"""The integration's own shipped translation catalog, as data.

Home Assistant loads exactly one file per language for a custom integration:
``translations/<lang>.json``. It does not read ``strings.json`` and it does
not resolve ``[%key:...%]`` references -- both of those belong to Core's
build tooling (``script/translations``), which custom integrations never run
through. So ``translations/en.json`` is not a generated artifact here, it is
the source of truth, and English is the one catalog required to be complete
(hassfest validates it for custom integrations).

That makes the English catalog the authority on *which* translation keys and
states exist, which is something the Python side genuinely needs to know:

  * ``select`` has to decide whether to normalize a raw Samsung option into
    a lowercase state key (so Home Assistant can look it up) or leave the
    vendor's own casing alone as a readable fallback.
  * ``laundry.cycle_select`` has to decide whether a device-reported course
    table has translations at all before keying off it.

Reading it from the catalog instead of restating it in Python means adding a
state or a course table is a one-file change, and the two can't drift.
