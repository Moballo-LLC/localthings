"""Cloud "Download" programs on a laundry device (issue #342).

Some course tables carry a course whose recipe isn't fixed in firmware --
selecting it runs whichever program was last pushed down from the
SmartThings cloud ("Download" / "Downloaded" in the course catalog). Three
tokens on ``/course/vs/0``'s ``x.com.samsung.da.options`` array drive it:

  ``CloudExtraCourse_<slot><slot>...``  the device's own list of downloaded
      program slots, one byte each -- the cloud counterpart of
      ``EditCourseList_`` for local courses.
  ``CloudCourse_<blob>``               the persisted default program.
  ``OneTimeCloudCourse_<blob>``        a this-run-only override.

A ``<blob>`` is an opaque fixed-width payload whose byte 2 is the slot id
it belongs to. Confirmed on two independent DA_WM_TP1_21_COMMON washers:
the issue #342 reporter's, whose ``CloudExtraCourse_0A5C286B2D0C55301A``
enumerates nine slots matching byte 2 of all nine of its programs exactly,
and the WA55A7700AV dump in ``tests/fixtures``, whose two-slot
``CloudExtraCourse_5958`` likewise matches its ``CloudCourse`` blob's byte
2. Blob width is *not* fixed across boards (20 bytes vs 16), which is one
reason nothing here ever synthesizes one.

``CloudExtraCourse_`` does not mean the same thing on every family, so
nothing keys off it directly -- see ``cloud_slots``, which is what the rest
of this module and its callers gate on. Even then, a device can advertise a
slot whose payload has never been observed, so ``cloud_slots`` answers
"which exist" while the store answers "which are usable"; the two are
deliberately allowed to disagree.

What this module does and deliberately does not do
--------------------------------------------------
The device advertises *which* slots exist but never what any of them is
called, and never the full blob for a slot other than the one currently
loaded. A blob is only observable while the device happens to be sitting on
that program, so the full payload is *learned by observation* and persisted
(same rationale as learned.py's mode store), and the human-readable name is
supplied by the user in the options flow. Nothing is hardcoded: no catalog
of program ids, no table of blobs, no assumed Download course code. A
hardcoded catalog was considered and rejected -- a blob is cloud-assigned
per account/region, so one user's captured payload is not evidence about
anyone else's device.

Blobs are replayed byte-for-byte, exactly as captured, and never
decomposed or rebuilt. (Bytes 5/7/9 of the reporter's blobs do decode
cleanly to that program's temperature/rinse/spin, but the same offsets
produce nonsense against the WA55A7700AV blob, so that decode is recorded
in docs/investigations/download-cycle.md rather than shipped.)
