"""Runtime discovery: device resources -> bound entities.

A device advertises a set of OCF resources keyed by href. For every href
present in the registry, emit the capability's entities bound to that resource.
Unknown hrefs are a coverage gap; each one is passed to the optional `log`
callback (as the raw href, not a formatted message) and otherwise skipped.

An href with a registered capability whose rt_filter/match_fn declines for
this particular device (e.g. a filter capability sitting on hardware that
doesn't have that filter) is *not* a gap — a maintainer already looked at
that href and decided how to handle it. Only hrefs absent from the registry
entirely are reported.
