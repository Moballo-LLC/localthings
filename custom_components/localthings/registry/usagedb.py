"""Decode the usage history the appliance keeps at `/file/transfer/vs/0`.

Issue #301. The resource serves a file -- named `/mnt/usage.db` whatever it
actually is, a firmware default that matches neither name `/file/list/vs/0`
reports -- as a wrapper of items each carrying a raw `blob`. Despite the
name it is not SQLite on any board measured so far, but a flat array of
fixed 12-byte records.

Two record shapes are known, and telling them apart matters for correctness
rather than tidiness, because **their second field means different things**:

    uint32-leading   <uint32 LE timestamp><uint32 LE cumulative energy,
                      tenths of a kWh><uint32 LE family-specific>
    uint64-leading   the ARTIK051_KRAC_18K shape (#301), whose value field
                      is cumulative *runtime hours*, not energy

Publishing one as the other would put hours in a kWh sensor, so the
`uint32`-leading shape has to be positively identified rather than assumed:
`records` returns nothing unless the whole file reads as a plausible,
ordered, daily-ish series whose counter actually moves. #329 proposed keying
on the leading field, which is necessary but *not* sufficient -- a
`uint64`-leading record whose date is a plain Unix timestamp puts that
timestamp in the low half and zeros in the high half, so it reads as a valid
leading `uint32` followed by a value of 0. That is why a counter which is
zero, or which never moves across the file, is refused too: on the shape
this module can read those mean "nothing to report", and on the shape it
cannot they are the tell.

The third field carries a different quantity on every family measured: zero
on a `DA_WM_TP1_21_COMMON` washer and on a dishwasher, the firmware's
monthly billing bucket on a `TP1X_REF_21K` fridge, and cumulative runtime
hours on an `ARTIK051_PRAC_20K`. Four families, one byte layout, three
meanings, and nothing in the bytes to say which -- so it is classified, not
assumed, and the classification decides both what is published from it and
whether the *second* field's scale is known (see
`_energy_scale_is_confirmed`). See
docs/investigations/file-transfer-usage-db.md.
