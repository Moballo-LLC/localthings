"""Capabilities for the Samsung Air Monitor Plus family (ASM-KR-TP1-22-*
board, issue #210) -- a small battery-powered standalone air-quality sensor
puck, not a controllable appliance. No `/power/*` resource at all (battery
only); this registry deliberately doesn't include common.POWER.

`/sensors/vs/0` is the same {type, value: [...]} items-list shape
air_purifier.AIR_QUALITY and range_hood.AIR_QUALITY already read via
common.sensor_item_value -- reused here rather than re-decoded, including
the same dust/fine_dust/super_fine_dust/odor/clean_level keys so this
device shares those capabilities' catalog entries. This board additionally
reports a CO2 reading the other two families don't.

A second `value` list element on the particulate-matter types (Dust's
`['31', '2']`) is the device's own graded air-quality level for that
reading -- see common.sensor_item_value. Still unbound here: the grade's
floor differs by board family, and CleanLevel already carries the
aggregate. This board's own readings are load-bearing evidence for the
PM mapping, though: 23 grading one step above the floor as FineDust is
what rules out a PM10-width band for that field.

Dust/FineDust/SuperFineDust carry the same HA `device_class`/`unit` as the
purifier family (issue #325, Dust=PM10 / FineDust=PM2.5 /
SuperFineDust=PM1 in μg/m³). The mapping rests on device-side grading this
board shares rather than on anything purifier-specific, so typing one
family and not the other would have been an inconsistency, not caution.

These sensors have recorded *unitless* long-term statistics since issue
#210, though, and Home Assistant suppresses statistics generation outright
for an entity whose unit no longer matches its recorded metadata -- so
stamping a unit on would have silently stopped the history it was meant to
label. __init__.py's v2->v3 entry migration relabels that metadata first.

# device_class/unit are taken from the shared rows; state_class deliberately
# is not. air_purifier leaves Odor/CleanLevel unstamped because they read as
# graded indices on that family, while this board has stamped all five as
# `measurement` since it was added (issue #210) -- consuming that column
# would silently drop long-term statistics for two sensors on shipped
# devices. The pm10/pm25/pm1 labels carry over cleanly, though: they rest on
# device-side grading this board shares (see the module docstring), and
# __init__.py's v2->v3 entry migration relabels the unitless statistics
# these five have been recording so the new unit doesn't suppress them.
