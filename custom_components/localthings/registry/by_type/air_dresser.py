"""AirDresser device registry (issue #162).

Reuses washer/dryer/dishwasher's shared laundry surface -- job-beginning
status, operational state, diagnosis, and (issue #208) the buzzer-sound
select -- /buzzersound/vs/0's rep on this board is the plain
{setBuzzerSound, supportedBuzzerSound} shape laundry.BUZZER_SOUND already
expects, no AirDresser-specific wiring needed. air_dresser.py holds the two
pieces specific to this device type: a minimal wrinkle-prevent-only
/washer/vs/0 capability, and the course select's own translation key.
